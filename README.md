# Description
React app that allows you to look for any trade in the firebase database with different types of parameters like: simbol(EURUSD,XAUUSD...), type(BUY,SELL), day of week and POI, that is something I use in my trading strategy to sort out the trades.
The app is a prototype, my objective with this app was to learn new technologies and make an app with a personal idea that could help me in my day by day in trading.
This app could be improve implementing login or other features.
